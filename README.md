### How To Use

-   For Firefox
    -   Go `about:preferences` / `Home`
    -   Set `Homepage and new windows` as `Custom URLs...`
    -   Set the custom url as the path of the `startpage.html`
        -   `EXAMPLE: file:///home/user/startpage.html`
-   For Google Chrome
    -   Go `chrome://settings/` / `Search Engine` / `On startup`
    -   Select `Open a specific page or set of pages`
    -   Click `Add New Page`
    -   Type the `startpage.html`'s path
        -   `EXAMPLE: file:///home/user/startpage.html`

> If you want to set this as New Tab page as well as Home page,
> Firefox natively doesn't support that. I presonally host my Home page
> in [GitHub Pages](https://berkinakkaya.github.io/startpage/startpage.html)
> and use [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)
> extension to set that page as my New Tab. You can do that as well or
> try [this solution](https://github.com/grtcdr/startpages#set-it-as-new-tab-page).
